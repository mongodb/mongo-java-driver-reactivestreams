# Quick Tour Primer

The aim of this guide is to provide background about the Java driver and its asynchronous API before going onto 
looking at how to use the driver and MongoDB.

See the [installation guide]({{< relref "getting-started/installation-guide.md" >}})
for instructions on how to install the MongoDB Reactive Streams Java Driver.

## Reactive Streams

This library is an implementation of the [reactive streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org) specification and the reactive stream API 
consists of the following components:

1. Publisher
2. Subscriber
3. Subscription

A `Publisher` is a provider of a potentially unbounded number of sequenced elements, published according to the demand received from it's `Subscriber(s)`.

In response to a call to `Publisher.subscribe(Subscriber)` the possible invocation sequences for methods on the `Subscriber` are given by the following protocol:

```
onSubscribe onNext* (onError | onComplete)?
```

This means that `onSubscribe` is always signalled, followed by a possibly unbounded number of `onNext` signals (as requested by `Subscriber`) 
followed by an `onError` signal if there is a failure, or an `onComplete` signal when no more elements are availableâ€”all as long as 
the `Subscription` is not cancelled.

For more information about reactive streams go to: [http://www.reactive-streams.org](http://www.reactive-streams.org).


## From Async Callbacks to Subscribers

The MongoDB Reactive Streams Java Driver is built upon the MongoDB Async driver which is callback driven.
The API mirrors the Async driver API and any methods that cause network IO return a `Publisher<T>`, 
where `T` is the type of response for the operation.  
The exception to that rule is for methods in the async driver that return a `Void` value in the callback. 
In [reactive streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org) this is forbidden, so in those circumstances we
return a [`Success`]({{< apiref "com/mongodb/reactivestreams/client/Success.html">}}) on the operation.

{{% note %}}
All [`Publishers`](http://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.1-javadoc/?org/reactivestreams/Publisher.html) returned 
from the API are cold, meaning that no I/O happens until they are subscribed to and the subscription makes a request. So just creating a 
`Publisher` won't cause any network IO. It's not until `Subscription.request()` is called that the driver executes the operation.

Publishers in this implementation are unicast. Each [`Subscription`](http://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.1-javadoc/?org/reactivestreams/Subscription.html) 
to a `Publisher` relates to a single MongoDB operation and its ['Subscriber'](http://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.1-javadoc/?org/reactivestreams/Subscriber.html)  
will receive its own specific set of results.

## Subscribers used in the Quick Tour

For the Quick Tour we have implemented a couple of different Subscribers and although this is an artificial scenario for reactive streams we
do block on the results of one example before starting the next, so as to ensure the state of the database.

1. ObservableSubscriber

    The base subscriber class is the [`ObservableSubscriber<T>`]({{< srcref "examples/tour/src/main/tour/SubscriberHelpers.java">}}), a Subscriber 
    that stores the results of the `Publisher<T>`. It also contains an `await()` method so we can block for results to ensure the state of 
    the database before going on to the next example.

2. OperationSubscriber

    An implementation of the `ObservableSubscriber` that immediately calls `Subscription.request` when it's subscribed to.

3.  PrintSubscriber

    An implementation of the `OperationSubscriber` that prints a message `Subscriber.onComplete`.

3.  PrintDocumentSubscriber

    An implementation of the `OperationSubscriber` that prints the json version of a `Document` when `Subscriber.onNext(Document document)` is called.


##  Blocking and non blocking examples

As our subscribers contain a latch that is only released when the `onComplete` method of the `Subscriber` is called, we can use that latch 
to block on by calling the `await` method.  Below are two examples using our auto-requesting `PrintDocumentSubscriber`.  
The first is non-blocking and the second blocks waiting for the `Publisher` to complete:

```java
// Create a publisher
Publisher<Document> publisher = collection.find();

// Non blocking
publisher.subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());

Subscriber<Document> subscriber = new PrintDocumentSubscriber();
publisher.subscribe(subscriber);
subscriber.await(); // Block for the publisher to complete
```

## Publishers, Subscribers and Subscriptions

In general `Publishers`, `Subscribers` and `Subscriptions` are a low level API and it's expected that users and libraries will build more 
expressive APIs upon them rather than solely use these interfaces.  As a library solely implementing these interfaces, users will benefit
from this growing ecosystem, which is a core design principle of reactive streams.

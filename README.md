## MongoDB Reactive Streams Java Driver ##

A [reactive streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) implementation of the Mongo Java Driver.

Please note this driver is currently experimental and the API has not been finalised and it could change.

This project depends on the Mongo Java Driver new core driver (3.0.0) and the reactive streams api (1.0.0.RC4)
so should be considered unstable until updated to released versions.
